This repository contains the text and source files necessary to generate _A metadata convention for processed acoustic data from active acoustic systems_ (link:docs/acmeta.adoc[AcMeta]), and is where new versions of the convention are discussed and developed.


Version 1.10 of the AcMeta convention (as ICES SISP 4-TG-AcMeta) is available https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/ICES%20Survey%20Protocols%20(SISP)/SISP-4%20A%20metadata%20convention%20for%20processed%20acoustic%20data%20from%20active%20acoustic%20systems.pdf[here]. Previous published versions were 1.0 (2013) and 1.05 (2014).

== Suggestions and contributions welcome
WGFAST welcomes suggestions, discussion, and contributions to this metadata convention.

Before submitting a pull request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits within the scope and aims of the convention, and whether your idea can be achieved within the existing metadata convention. It is your role to adequately explain and justify the merits of what you want. Please provide as much detail and context as possible. Good pull requests remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

*Please ask the convention coordinators before starting on any _significant_ edits*. Otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the convention coordinators might not want to merge into the project.
